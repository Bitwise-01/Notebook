## How does work?

### Register

1. Generates a 16-bytes **(128-bits)** AES key
2. Derives a master key from your password
3. Encrypts AES key using master key
4. Hashes your password
5. Saves hashed password to database
6. Saves encrypted AES key to database

### Login

1. Derives a master key from your password
2. Saves master key into your browser's session

### Encrypt data

1. Gets your master key from your session
2. Uses your master key to decrypt your AES key
3. Uses your decrypted AES key to encrypt your data

### Decrypt data

1. Gets your master key from your session
2. Uses your master key to decrypt your AES key
3. Uses your decrypted AES key to decrypt your data

### Notice:

**Your master key is only derivable from your plain-text password**<br>
**Your plain-text is only available when you are logging in**<br>
**Your master key is never saved into a database**<br>
**Your decrypted AES key is never saved**

### Warning:

**If you lost your password, then your notes will be lost as well**
